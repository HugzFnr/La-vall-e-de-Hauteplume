# La-vallee-de-Hauteplume

All of the docs that I write/draw and update (in french, sorry) to organize roleplaying sessions on the universe + rules system I've made. It's called "La Vall√©e de Hauteplume" and it's a heroic fantasy setup with a fun and artistic kind of magic; and much to explore ;).

In this RPG you start your journey in the Hauteplume City, capital (and a massive one for a medieval setup) of the Hauteplume valley, the only part you know of the big world of Dvalir. You just have been graduated from the Academy, making you an Artist, trained to the art of Drawing, to combat and full of knowledge about your region. Drawing is the gift your saint and unique goddess Nature gave to each Citizen at their birth, enabling them to mentally shift to one of the 7 subnatural planes, draw a form in this plane (rocks, plants, beams of light...) and then summon it in the reality for a short duration.

Your journey began at your graduation ceremony, when the High Priest all gave you the Hauteplume : a civil conflict just started ravaging the city and your help is required to solve it. Your choices shall matter.

SPOILER ALERT 
After you solve this conflict and no matter how, the Council will probably ask you to go explore the world outside the valley after getting equipped and saying goodbye to your family. Depending on what you did, it can be a quest for knowledge for the Academy, a mean to reduce the number of Artists in the city, or an exile, or ...
END OF THE SPOILER

The different game systems are explained in details in the corresponding documents but for the TLDR version :
- d100 rolls for most difficult actions, based on the characther/NPC's attributes + one of their skills if it fits
- extraordinary skills can allow players to do things otherwise considered impossible with a certain chance of success. They are the only skills that can affect drawings.
- all weapons are categorized in few types, they deal interesting amounts of damage and can be countered by different defensive moves
- drawings aren't dependant on dice rolls except for their damages (the formula is defined by the Gift of the caster, cf the according sheets). Each character knows their limits thanks to the MICA system (Movement Intensity Complexity Amplitude), whose values depend on their level and class. Drawings are designed to be the Core of the game, thus they are more interesting than weapons as they can't be dodged (you can't predict where the fire ball will be summoned) and quickly deal higher damages on higher zones of impact; they also enable many more things than dealing damage.
- combat maps are managed by the GM thanks to a model with character tokens, spell tokens, etc... In combat, each player is given his point of the view of the action, then they each quickly describe their actions to the GM that will make them happen simultaneously, depending on the dice rolls (or not).
