# La-vallee-de-Hauteplume

All of the docs that I write/draw and update (in french, sorry) to organize roleplaying sessions on the universe + rules system I've made. It's called "La Vall√©e de Hauteplume" and it's a heroic fantasy setup with a fun and artistic kind of magic; and much to explore ;).
